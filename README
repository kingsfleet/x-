This repository is for a very simple project called x! which is a friday evening experiement as to whether you could fit a useful XML api specification into a single twitter message. (http://is.gd/xspec)

Incidentially the x! name comes from a rather obscure, small but ultimately very helpfull character in the book "The Also People". (http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Also_People)
